# TraderSnax

Web app that allows users to sign in, rate, and review Trader Joe's products.

This web app was built using Bootstrap, HTML, PHP, Javascript, JQuery, and MySQL. Users must register their account before leaving reviews, but after logging into the web app they are able to see a list of products with discriptions and reviews from other users. The goal of this web app was to allow users to rate and leave custom reviews on their favorite snacks from Trader Joe's. Users are also able to customize their account with individual profile images, and a short description about themselves.

Users can register for Trader Snax by entering their full name, email address, unique username, password of at least 6 characters, and a profile image.

Here about 30 snacks from Trader Joe's are displayed for the user to explore. Hovering over each snack will flip the card which contains the description for the snack along with the option to read more or review the snack. If the user decides to read more about a snack, they are brought to the individual snack page where they can see all the reviews for the snack from other users. If the user decides to review the snack, they are brought to the review page for the snack to rate and review the snack as they wish. Back on the product page, the user is also able to search for other users by using the search bar on the nav bar. Clicking a username will redirect the user to the profile page of the user they clicked on and see what snacks they have reviewed. The user can see their page by clicking their profile photo on the top right of the nav bar. Here they will be able to see and edit their information and look at all the snacks they have rated. Users will also be able to add a short description about themselves in the 'about me' section. Once the user is finished, they can click the logout button on the nav bar.
