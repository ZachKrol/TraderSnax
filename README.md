# TraderSnax

Web app that allows users to sign in, rate, and review Trader Joe's products.

This web app was built using boostrap html, php, javascript, and mysql. It had three databases that communicated with each other. Users must register their account before leaving reviews, but after logging into the web app they are able to see a list of products with discriptions and reviews from other users. The goal of this web app was to allow users to rate and leave custom reviews on their favorite snacks from Trader Joe's. Users are also able to customize their account with individual profile images, and a short description about themselves.
